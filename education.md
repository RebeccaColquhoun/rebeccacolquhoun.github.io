I completed my integrated masters in Earth Sciences at the University of Oxford in June 2020. I am now a Probabtionary Research Student on the NERC DTP in Environmental Research, as part of the Department of Earth Sciences.

## Postgraduate

I am now reading for a DPhil (PhD) in Earth Sciences as part of the NERC DTP in Environmental Research. I am funded by a NERC studentship alongside a prestigious Oxford-Radcliffe Scholarship. My research focusses on earthquake determinism, please see the [research](/research) page for more information about my experience and interests.
