## Talks and Panels
I convened and chaired a panel on _LGBTQ+ Voices and Communities: Enabling Inclusivity in Environmental Research_ for the Oxford NERC DTP in Environmental Research. This involved contacting and engaging three speakers, coming up with questions, engaging students and ensuring they felt comfortable contributing. I then chaired the 1.5 hour panel. 

I co-led a departmental group following the URGE curriculum, including reading on anti-racism and producing a number of 'deliverables' (policies, memos, white-papers and resources) for the department. As part of this I facilitated fortnightly discussion sessions for a group from across the department including undergraduates, postgraduates, post-docs and faculty. For this work I was awarded the departmental EEDI prize.
