My research interests surround earthquake nucleation and seismic hazard. During my DPhil, I hope to investigate earthquake determinism and its impact on hazard mititigation particularly Earthquake Early Warning Systems.  

**Extended Work**
* Masters Project (October 2019 - May 2020)
  * I used foreshock-aftershock ratios found from Phase Coherence to examine to what extent external processes are involved in Earthquake Nucleation. 
  * Abstract:
    * "There are two main models of earthquake nucleation: deterministic and stochastic. If ex- ternal processes are involved in nucleation, such as aseismic slip or pore pressure changes, we call this deterministic. Whereas if nucleation follows a cascade where one earthquake triggers the next, and one of these is the mainshock then this is stochastic. I applied phase coherence methods to detect foreshocks and aftershocks which are close in space and time to the mainshock and I was able to detect earthquakes down to M1. I found that on the Hikurangi subduction zone, New Zealand, there were far fewer foreshocks than expected from a stochastic nucleation and thus external processes must be involved in earthquake nucleation." 

* 3rd Year Extended Essay (January 2019 – April 2019)
  * Wrote a 4000-word, review style essay entitled: Earthquake Early Warning Systems: are they the panacea they are billed as?
  * Conducted entirely independently
  * Abstract:
    * "Earthquake early warning (EEW) systems act to warn users of ground-shaking before it is felt at that location. This allows reactive measures to be taken such as “drop, cover, and hold-on”, evacuation and shutting down of industrial units, potentially saving many lives. EEW can use a variety of algorithms which have varying alert lead-times and have been implemented around the world. EEW systems are often viewed as a panacea for saving lives in earthquakes, but other mitigation measures exist and may be more appropriate and effective in certain settings. Two settings where EEW systems have been rolled-out are Mexico and California, and these will be reviewed before considering if an EEW system is the most effective earthquake mitigation measure for Nepal."

* 3rd year Independent Research Project (June 2018 - August 2018)
  * A six-week independent project investigating polygonal faults of the Vøring Basin, and the effect of these faults on the Opal-A to Opal-CT diagenetic horizon. Included mapping horizons in 3D seismic reflection data in Petrel, taking detailed throw measurements across faults, and producing contoured 3D fault throw maps.
  * Conducted within the Shell Laboratory, University of Oxford
  * Supervised by Prof. Joe Cartwright
  
**Research Assistanceships**
* Undergraduate Research Assistant, University of Oxford (June - July 2019) 
  * A six-week research assistantship investigating active tectonics in the Alboran Sea using 2D seismic reflection data in Petrel. Included detailed mapping of the seabed and other horizons, independently incorporating well-log data. Identified data anomalies and made quality control checks on data to ensure consistency, applying corrections where needed. 
  * Invited to work under Prof. Richard Walker and Dr Claudia Bertoni, after my 3rd Year Independent Research Project.
* MDRS "Matryoshka" Project, University of Oxford (November 2017 - April 2018)
  * Designed, proposed and executed a project at the Mars Analog in Utah, looking at the accuracy of site selection on Mars at different scales (spectroscopically, from satellite imagery and from human and drone observation). Particular oversight for site selection from satellite data. Took part in post-mission analysis including some XRD. 
  * Presented the results at a symposium on Mars at the University of Oxford.
  * Conducted as an super-curricular activity.
* Undergraduate Research Assistant, University of Oxford (August 2017)
  * Worked for Professor Nick Tosca to assist with measurement of the average crystal sizes of calcite. Required a systematic and thorough approach and a close eye for detail to ensure that the crystals measured were representative and the density of measured crystals was as high as possible.
