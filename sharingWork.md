***Wider engagement and EDI work***
* I presented my masters work at a [TETHYS seminar](https://www.tethys-talks.com), which is a seminar series aimed at an early undergraduate level audience. You can watch a recording of this talk on youtube [here](https://youtu.be/kzC1ehpVHM4?t=1561) (starts at 26:01). (November 2020). 

* I appeared on a panel at AGU 2020 talking about racial inclusion and diversity efforts in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Oxford. You can read about this work in an article I co-authored for Astronomy and Geophysics, which is open-access [here](https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/61/5/5.40/5906544). (December 2020).
