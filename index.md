I'm Rebecca, a 2nd year DPhil student in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Oxford. I'm interested in earthquake mechanics and seismic hazard, as well as a range of EDI issues. My thesis is focussed on understanding earthquake determinism using a variety of methods.
I completed my MEarthSci in Earth Sciences from Oxford in June 2020.
